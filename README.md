# landing_proj2
So this is my first front-end project, made purely of HTML and CSS, and I just transcripted similar Figma design into code, so the general idea of the design is not mine. This project is just for demonstration of my BEM methodology skills.
P.S.: It's called landing_proj2 because i had some issues when publishing landing_proj1 to github.
